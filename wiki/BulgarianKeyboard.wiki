The package itself replaces the !TextInput_ru.bundle with modified files. Here are the steps that I used, developing the package:

  * Used IDA to disassemble the binary.
  * After some looking found `\0\0` terminated 4 byte unicode characters.
  * I have mapped the positions and did some hex editing
  * Found out that artwork should be edited. No utility supporting !Text_Bundle_ru was available, so hunt for offsets and sizes began..
  * Modified one .py script to extract and assemble the artwork.
  * Edited the keyboard images with Gimp:
    * Removing the letters from the background.
    * Creating layouts for Russian and BG Phonetic keyboard (I'll publish XCF files soon).
  * Assembled the modified .artwork
  * Resigned the modified binary
  * Created the debian package.

All this was done in two days.
